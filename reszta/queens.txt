At first, we need to define a representation of the board. Each square of chessboard can be represented by a pair of X and Y coordinates. We can write such pair as X/Y, where / is only for visual purposes. We know that each queen should be at a different row or column thus, we can define a template as [1/Y1, 2/Y2, 3/Y3, 4/Y4, 5/Y5, 6/Y6, 7/Y7, 8/Y8]

We can generilize our solution with two cases. Case 1: THe list fo queens is empty. This is in fact a solution since there is no attack. Case 2. The list looks like this [X/Y|Others] Then we should look at three conditions for this case (1) There must be no attack in Others. Others must itself be a solution. (2) X and Y must be integers between 1 and 8. (3) X/Y must not attack any queen in Others. Our solution template means that all queens are in different columns. Then a) Y-coordinates should be different, b) they should not be in the same diagonal.  Then here is the algorithm:?- template(S), solution(S).
